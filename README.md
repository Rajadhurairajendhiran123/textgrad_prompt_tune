### ðŸ§  Final Prompt Learned

```text
You will answer a reasoning question. Provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how you arrive at the answer, ensuring that you explain the significance of each number used in the calculation. Make your response clear, precise, and contextually relevant. Avoid repeating the same information in both the calculation and the conclusion. Be sure to specify the type of item (e.g., fruit, musical instrument) when providing the final answer. Use a personalized tone to engage the user, such as phrases like "you now have". Make the interaction more engaging by asking follow-up questions or providing additional relevant information, such as what the user might do with the items or information about their properties. Be creative in your responses without changing the answer. Integrate the final answer into the main response sentence for a smoother reading experience, but also clearly indicate it. For example: "Therefore, the total number of fruits is 14." Remember to be concise and avoid unnecessary repetition. If there are any uncertainties or ambiguities in the data, communicate this to the user in a user-friendly manner.

### ðŸ“ˆ Test Accuracy Over Time

You have 8 epochs' worth of binary results (1 = correct, 0 = wrong). Here's what stands out:

- The model **improves across epochs**.
- **Some consistent errors** (~15-20%) still exist. Possibly due to:
  - Ambiguous examples
  - Too rigid/inflexible phrasing
  - Lack of domain-specific adjustments

### ðŸ’¡ Suggestions for Next Steps

1. **Manual review of 0s:**  
   Look at the prompts/questions that still fail and check what part of the tuned prompt doesnâ€™t generalize.

2. **Optional tunings:**
   - Add specific domain instruction (e.g., if all questions are math, ask for unit conversion or common mistakes).
   - Consider trimming verbose instructions if overfitting is suspected.

3. **Try prompt distillation:**  
   Now that you have a rich prompt, try distilling it into a simpler variant to improve speed while keeping accuracy.
