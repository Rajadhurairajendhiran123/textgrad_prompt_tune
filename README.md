## ðŸ“Š Final Prompt Design and Evaluation Summary

### ðŸ§  Final Prompt

> You will answer a reasoning question. Provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how you arrive at the answer, ensuring that you explain the significance of each number used in the calculation.  
> Make your response clear, precise, and contextually relevant. Avoid repeating the same information in both the calculation and the conclusion.  
> Be sure to specify the type of item (e.g., fruit, musical instrument) when providing the final answer.  
> Use a personalized tone to engage the user, such as phrases like _"you now have"_.  
> Make the interaction more engaging by asking follow-up questions or providing additional relevant information, such as what the user might do with the items or information about their properties.  
> Be creative in your responses without changing the answer.  
> Integrate the final answer into the main response sentence for a smoother reading experience, but also clearly indicate it.  
> For example: _"Therefore, the total number of fruits is **14**."_  
> Remember to be concise and avoid unnecessary repetition.  
> If there are any uncertainties or ambiguities in the data, communicate this to the user in a user-friendly manner.
